Features:
Type info from notification panel? That would be nice for making small changes...
Merge with tasque project? It seems doable. We'll see. (already added task window).
Modify task tracker to use a sqlite database, instead of using xml. This should be a fairly simple change.

Bugs:
Change task priority to just numbers, instead of next/today/month/etc...
