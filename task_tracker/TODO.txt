Type info from notification panel? That would be nice for making small changes...
Merge with tasque project? It seems doable. We'll see. (already added task window).
Change 'Edit' option on current task pop up to 'View'.
Add 'View' task option to pop up reminder.

Find a way to fix the tray icon text (it says 'notify-sharp' instead of task tracker).
Modify task tracker to use a sqlite database, instead of using xml. This should be a fairly simple change.
Fix the menu so it doesn't overlap the tray.
