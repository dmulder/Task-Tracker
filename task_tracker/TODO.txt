Type info from notification panel? That would be nice for making small changes...
Merge with tasque project? It seems doable. We'll see. (already added task window).
Add a 'Save' button in Edit view. Change to 'Save' and 'Close', instead of 'OK' and 'Cancel'. Maybe change the name of the window (right now it is Add a Task). I use it more for viewing and reading what needs to be done.
Change 'Edit' option on current task pop up to 'View'.
Add 'View' task option to pop up reminder.
Find a way to fix the tray icon text (it says 'notify-sharp' instead of task tracker).
Make the Add Task window larger (change window name to 'Task').
