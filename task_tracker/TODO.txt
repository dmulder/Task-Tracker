Features:
Type info from notification panel? That would be nice for making small changes...
Merge with tasque project? It seems doable. We'll see. (already added task window).
Modify task tracker to use a sqlite database, instead of using xml. This should be a fairly simple change.

Bugs:
Fix Task priority so that it isn't reset every time the addTask window is opened.
Change task priority to just numbers, instead of next/today/month/etc...
After editing and saving a task, the changes don't appear if I immediatly re-open the task from the Task window. After closing the Task window and re-opening, the changes are there.
If I change the title of a task, the subtasks are all automatically marked as finished. The task start date also changes to today.
